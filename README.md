# mcscr.site

## why make this?
mcscr.site was gonna expire in under a week, and I thought "why can't I make some random websites?".\
so I asked Gemini to make it.

<small>but i thought it was mid, so i ended up editing this by myself & github copilot\
...cursor did most of it.</small>

## features
tl;dr:
- <a href="https://mcscr.jp">mcscr.jp</a> pages but translated to english
- Terminal-like design (gemini did it)

I wanted to copy? sample? the <a href="https://mcscr.jp">mcscr.jp</a> website.\
I asked AI<small>s</small> to do that. but an AI doesn't even visit the page.\
and another AI made their own, with unique design, but no referrences to <a href="https://mcscr.jp">mcscr.jp</a>.\
so I yoinked the data from <a href="https://github.com/ScratchJP/mcscrjp">ScratchJP/mcscrjp</a>, and translated to english.
...well cursor did most of work even i didn't say. it's alright
<small>cursor did 60% of the thing</small>
